## Some fun variables for extra - codebook
- x_train,y_train,x_test,y_test : variables to import files
- x_test_df, X_traind_df : while not data frames, reminded me that I had a list to work with
- hold : vector of features 
- true, stdtrue : truth vector of mean and std - this was to help label and select desired aspects of the list
- test, train were the final version of the x and y list with also an identifier to test/train
- data is the final combination of trand and test and contains only the desired columns
